\section{Software Stack}

The design goals of the software stack are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Open source
\item Active community support
\item Cross-platform
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Platform}
\subsubsection{Operating System}
Official \href{https://www.olimex.com/wiki/A20-OLinuXino-LIME#How_to_generate_boot-able_SD-card_Debian_Linux_image_for_A20-OLinuXino-LIME.3F}{Olimex LIME Debian} based on Linux kernel 3.4.90+ downloaded as a SD-card image file . Custom linux systems may also be built following tutorials on the download page.

\subsubsection{Interpreter}

Package:	\href{https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-279/}{Python 2.7}

Python is a simple, cross-platform, object-oriented programming language that is widely used across the open-source community.

\subsubsection{SPI, I2C, GPIO}
	
Package:	\href{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyA20Lime}{pyA20Lime}

SPI/I2C/GPIO is used to communicate with the power management IC. GPIO is used to control and monitor the Telit GE910-GNSS. GPIO is used to control the system, network, location and fault LEDs.
    
\subsection{Location}

\subsubsection{GPS utilities}

Package:	\href{https://github.com/Knio/pynmea2}{pynmea2}

GPS location will be determined using the on-board GPS/GSNS block inside the Telit GE910-GNSS module. Location strings are given in the following format:
\begin{quote}
<UTC>,<latitude>,<longitude>,<hdop>,<altitude>,<fix>,<cog>,<spkm>,<spkn>,<date>,<nsat>
\end{quote}

\begin{table} 
    \begin{tabular}{ c c }
        a & b \\ 
        c & d \\ 
    \end{tabular} 
    \caption{testing} 
\end{table}
